## How to Deploy your app instantly

Once you have signed in, you will be presented with a dashboard like this:

![Dashboard](/public/images/dashboard.png)

## Account Overview

This will show you the total number of apps you have, the number of apps running and the account plan. Currently there's only one plan (ie Hobby).

## Applications

This will show all your applications and their states. Apps have 4 States:

1. Running
2. Exited
3. Building
4. Failed

<Note>The dashboard will also display how long an app was running or exited</Note>

You can also manage your apps by stopping, starting, updating and deleting them by pressing their respective buttons. See image below:

<Tip>If your app is marked as failed, look at the Build Logs</Tip>

## Creating An App

<Warning>All apps must have a Shipfile. To lean more about it go to the [Shipfile section](/shipfile)</Warning>

To create a new app go to the dashboard and click the `Deploy New App` button. You will fill in the following details:

1. App Name: This will be the subdomain of your application (ie: appname.deploy.tz)
2. Stack: Choose the appropriate stack of your application. You can request a stack to be added if it is not available.
3. Respository URL: Provide a link to the Github respository hosting your application.
4. Environmental variables: If your app needs environmental variables, you can place them here.

Once your app is running you should see its status as `UP`.
